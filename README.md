# Cranial

A superset of the Brainfuck programming language intended to add additional functionality. This project has very little practical use
and is instead supposed to be a personal project.

This readme is not final and will be updated until project has been completed.

## Changes From Original Brainfuck

* Increase tape size from 30,000 bytes to 65,535 bytes
* Allow for input and output of both characters and raw numbers
* Incorporate UTF-8 support for both input and output
